I have always loved the essence of programming and it is the only reason i am standing where i am in my educational path.I have worked on various Academic projects and the ones that i loved the most working on are the Web App development projects . I have both experience and knowledge on how Web Applications work. I am acquainted with web technology stacks like MERN (Mongo, Express ,React js, Node js) and i have also worked with Flask+React stack for web app development. I also have some basic knowledge in Android App development. I would consider Python to be my favorite programming language because i just love how versatile the language is . But i wouldn't stop myself from learning complex programming languages as proof Java is the language which i am the strongest in next to Python.  </p>
